It was lost due to decades of neglect. Kalpana Ramesh, the activist, has decided to clean up garbage and debris. After restoring the MJ Market, IT Industry and Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao promised revival of stepwells (bowlis) in the City. The Gachibowli well is waiting for its restoration. The well is amid a variety of Nizam period architecture. It is well within a well which has three flights of steps, two on each storey. It is in the shape of a square with four arches. The well is not on the State heritage list of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). It is a bit dislocated with continuous dumping of debris due to which the square shape got disturbed and the edges have been damaged. Beside the well, two borewells were dug causing more damage to it. Adding to the damages, locals have laid a concrete road near the well. "No one knows deep down inside how much damage was caused to the well, as the beautiful steps are not visible," shares Kalpana.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">For centuries, a traditional construction for harvesting rain in the arid regions of India, stepwells, has helped people overcome water scarcity in the dry seasons. Stepwells, also known as 'Baolis' and 'Vav' in Hindi, are large subterranean stone structures built to provide water for drinking and agriculture.These stepwells are important for ground water recharging apart from being part of the city's precious heritage.These can also help in the water scarcity problem in India. Stepwells tell us much about the region's ecology and history. Stepwells were sites for drinking, washing and bathing, as well as for festivals and sacred rituals.They have also been a promising source of water for irrigating crops and watering forests in arid regions.</p>

                    <p>Groundwater sources are beneath the land surface and include springs and wells. As can be seen from the water cycle, when rain falls to the ground, some water flows along the land to streams or lakes, some water evaporates into the atmosphere, some is taken up by plants, and some seeps into the ground. As water seeps into the ground, it enters a zone referred to as the unsaturated zone or vadose zone. Water moves through the unsaturated zone into the saturated zone, where the interconnected openings between rock particles are filled with water.</p>

                    <p>Vegetation plays an important role in the water cycle by preventing soil erosion and increasing groundwater levels. In areas with thick vegetation cover, the foliage cover breaks the force of precipitation falling on the ground, which may otherwise cause erosion. Green plants also release water vapor in the air as a by-product of photosynthesis, thus involving groundwater in the water cycle.</p>

                    <p>The groundwater found below the water table comes from precipitation that has seeped through surface soil.The water table level can vary in different areas and even within the same area. Fluctuations in the water table level are caused by changes in precipitation between seasons and years. During late winter and spring, when snow melts and precipitation is high, the water table rises. During the summer months, the water table tends to fall, because of low precipitation and in part to plants taking up water from the soil surface before it can reach the water table.</p>
